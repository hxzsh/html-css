In this course, I gained a solid understanding of HTML and CSS through practical exercises and a final project, where we built a YouTube clone step by step.

Key topics covered:
	•	HTML & CSS fundamentals
	•	Styling techniques: hovers, transitions, shadows, text styles
	•	Chrome DevTools & CSS box model
	•	Layouts with Flexbox, CSS Grid, and positioning
